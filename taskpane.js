        intro: `Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) represents a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately 1 in 15,000 individuals worldwide. This autosomal recessive disorder results from defects in adrenal steroidogenesis, leading to impaired cortisol production and subsequent overproduction of adrenal androgens. The clinical manifestations of CAH are severe and life-threatening, including salt-wasting crises, virilization, and impaired growth and development. Current standard of care with glucocorticoid replacement therapy, while life-saving, is associated with significant morbidity including growth suppression, obesity, and metabolic complications.

Crinetide, a novel synthetic ACTH analogue, represents a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of CAH. By selectively stimulating cortisol production while minimizing androgen excess, Crinetide has the potential to address the fundamental pathophysiology of CAH while avoiding the adverse effects associated with supraphysiological glucocorticoid dosing. This Phase 2 study aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of Crinetide in adult patients with CAH, with the goal of establishing proof-of-concept for this innovative therapeutic strategy.`,

        objectives: `Primary Objectives:
1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Crinetide administered subcutaneously in adult patients with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia over a 12-week treatment period.
2. To assess the efficacy of Crinetide in normalizing morning cortisol levels compared to placebo in patients with CAH.
3. To determine the optimal dose of Crinetide for achieving physiological cortisol levels while minimizing adverse events.
4. To evaluate the effect of Crinetide on adrenal androgen levels (17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione) compared to baseline and placebo.

Secondary Objectives:
1. To assess the impact of Crinetide on quality of life measures using validated CAH-specific questionnaires.
2. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of Crinetide and its relationship to clinical response.
3. To assess changes in body composition and metabolic parameters during Crinetide treatment.
4. To evaluate the effect of Crinetide on bone mineral density and bone turnover markers.
5. To assess patient-reported outcomes including fatigue, mood, and overall well-being.`,

        methodology: `Study Design: This Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Crinetide in adult patients with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia. The study employs a parallel-group design with three active dose arms and one placebo arm, with adaptive dose selection based on interim safety and efficacy data.

Patient Population: Eligible patients will be adults aged 18-65 years with genetically confirmed CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, currently receiving stable glucocorticoid replacement therapy for at least 6 months. Patients must have documented elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels (>2x upper limit of normal) and demonstrate suboptimal disease control despite optimized conventional therapy. Key exclusion criteria include pregnancy, significant comorbidities, and use of investigational drugs within 30 days.

Treatment Regimen: Patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive subcutaneous Crinetide at doses of 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, or 2.0 mg daily, or matching placebo, for 12 weeks. All patients will continue their background glucocorticoid therapy with dose adjustments permitted based on clinical response. The study includes a 4-week screening period, 12-week treatment period, and 4-week follow-up period.

Statistical Considerations: The study is powered to detect a 30% difference in morning cortisol normalization between active treatment and placebo arms, with 80% power and Î±=0.05. A total of 80 patients (20 per arm) will be enrolled to account for potential dropouts. Primary efficacy analysis will use ANCOVA with baseline cortisol as covariate, and safety analysis will include all randomized patients who receive at least one dose of study drug.`
